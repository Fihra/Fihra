### Hi there ğŸ‘‹

<!--
**Fihra/Fihra** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

I'm a technical sound designer and full-stack software engineer! As an avid music & audio person, I try to align my interests of audio with technology.

    Currently relearning Unity & Wwise to prep for game jams again
    Working with React Hooks and relearning PostgresSQL to plan to build a full-stack app
    Taking a break from learning & practicing C++ & JUCE Framework

Besides tech stuff

    I compose game music & release game/anime covers.
